story=A father and his son&were taking their donkey to town&to sell him&at the marketplace.&They had not gone a great distance,&when they met a group of pretty maidens&who were return from town.&The young girls were talking and laughing,&when one of them cried out, "Look there,&Did you ever see such fools,&to be walking alongside the donkey when they might be riding on it?"&The father, when he heard this,&told his son to get up on the donkey,&and he continued to stroll along merrily.&They traveled a little further down the road,&and soon came upon a group of old men talking.&"There," said one of them,&"that proves what I was saying.&What respect is shown to old age in these days?&Do you see that idle boy riding the donkey.&while his father has to walk?&You should get down&and let your father ride!&Upon this, the son got down from the donkey&They had not gone far&when they happened upon a group of women and children.&"Why, you lazy old fellow,&you should be ashamed,"&cried several women at once.&"How can you ride upon the beast,&when that poor little boy can hardly keep up with you?"&So the good-natured father hoisted his son up behind him.&By now they had almost reached the town.&"Tell me friend," said a townsman,&"is that donkey your own?"&"Why yes," said the father.&"I would not have thought so," said the other,&"by the way you overwork him.&Why, you two are strong&and are better able to carry the poor beast than he is to carry you."&"we can only try."&So he and his son got down from the donkey.&They tied the animal's legs together,&and , taking a pole,&tried to carry him on their sholders&over a bridge&that led to the marketplace.&This was such an odd sight&that crowds of people gathered around to see it,&and to laugh at it.&The doneky, not liking to be tied,&kicked so ferociously&that he broke the rope&tumbled off the pole into the water,&and scrambled away into the thicket.&With this,&the father and his son hung down their heads&and made their way home again,&having learned that by trying to please everybody,&they had please nobody&and lost the donkey too.
